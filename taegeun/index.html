                        I know I came off a bit strong the first time we met, but that’s the only way I knew how to make friends and I really wanted to be friends with you!
                        <br><br>
                        You were someone I thought I needed to pull out from their shell and I am very glad I tried as much as I did. I enjoy being with you and I know how much you try to understand and accept me as a person.
                        <br><br>
                        I want to thank you for calling me out to meet up as often as you do. I felt very seen and it was always so fun to be able to hear more about you. I hope I’ve been a good presence in your life and I will continue to try to be one. I want us to be able to grow and learn from each other!
                        <br><br>
                        I cant really tell you what I want without making you run off because of how emotional I am so I will stop here for your sake.

                        앞으로 잘 지내고 놀고 싶을때 또 부르면 무조건 나와볼게~
