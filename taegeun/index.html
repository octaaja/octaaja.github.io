                        I know I came off a bit strong the first time we met, but that’s the only way I knew how to make friends and I really wanted to be friends with you!
                        <br><br>
                        I want to thank you for calling me out to meet up as often as you do. I felt very seen and it was always so fun to be able to hear more about you. I hope I’ve been a good presence in your life and I will continue to try to be one. I want us to be able to grow and thrive together!
