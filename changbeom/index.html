                    <b>Happy birthday cutie! I just wanna thank you for all the time weve been together and the time we'll spend together in the future. I hope I’ve been a good friend to you and that I've been a good addition to your life. 
                        <br><br>
                        Who knew we would be talking every day, right? We talked about this recently but I remember the first time we met and how you kept making fun of me? You know I added you because I liked that right? I enjoyed playing with you then and each time I've played with you after and I actually am so glad I can call you my friend.
                        <br><br>
                        I hope your 19 is how you imagined it to be. I hope you discover more of yourself. I hope you learn the things you want and need to. I hope you can take things slow and take in all of what the next year of your life has to offer you. I believe you will do well, even if you might not think so sometimes. I believe you will be the person you want and can be and you will make the decisions you can in the situations you are presented. 
                        <br><br>
                        You've always helped me when you could and spent your time with me when you can and I'm always thankful for that. The Hyunjun I know tries his best to understand people and makes them feel safe and free to be themselves and I respect you for that. I want you to know how much you mean to me and how much I value our friendship. I hope I can be someone you rely on.
                        <br><br>
                        I want us to meet and for us to do all the stuff we couldn't because we are so far away. I want to treat you to stuff like you deserve and I want to make more fun memories with you!!!
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you for being there for me. I hope we can stay being friends for a long time.</b>

                        생일축하해 우리 귀여운 현준이!!! 너랑 같이 생일 보낼수있으면 좋겠는데 너무 멀리 있어서 많이 아쉽다. 내 친구 되서 너무 고맙고 나랑 같이 있어줘서 너무너무 고마워.
                        <br><br>
                        너 처음 만났을때 너무 외롭고 그랬었는데 그때도 그렇고 지금도 그렇고 너랑 같이 있는게 너무 좋아. 너랑 진지한 얘기도 하고 같이 놀고 다 할수있어서 너무 행복해! 고민이나 문제 있으면 나한테 말해줄수있는거 알지? 나 너한테 위로 많이 받았는데 나도 너한테 그런 사람 될수있으면 좋겠다. 나한테 기대하고 싶으면 해도 돼. 너 나한테 크게 도움이 되는 사람인거 알아줬으면 좋겠고 나 너 생각하면 좋은 추억들만 가득해. <br>
                        앞으로 너랑 하고 싶은것 많아서 어디 가면 안돼! 나중에 만나고 밥 같이 먹고 술도 먹고 얼굴 많이 보자!
