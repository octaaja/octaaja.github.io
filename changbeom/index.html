                    <b>Happy birthday cutie! I just wanna thank you for all the time weve been together and the time we'll spend together in the future. I hope Iâ€™ve been a good friend to you and that I've been a good addition to your life. 
                        <br><br>
                        Who knew we would be talking every day, right? We talked about this recently but I remember the first time we met and how you kept making fun of me? You know I added you because I liked that right? I enjoyed playing with you then and each time I've played with you after and I actually am so glad I can call you my friend.
                        <br><br>
                        I hope your 19 is how you imagined it to be. I hope you discover more of yourself. I hope you learn the things you want and need to. I hope you can take things slow and take in all of what the next year of your life has to offer you. I believe you will do well, even if you might not think so sometimes. I believe you will be the person you want and can be and you will make the decisions you can in the situations you are presented. 
                        <br><br>
                        You've always helped me when you could and spent your time with me when you can and I'm always thankful for that. The Hyunjun I know tries his best to understand people and makes them feel safe and free to be themselves and I respect you for that. I want you to know how much you mean to me and how much I value our friendship. I hope I can be someone you rely on.
                        <br><br>
                        I want us to meet and for us to do all the stuff we couldn't because we are so far away. I want to treat you to stuff like you deserve and I want to make more fun memories with you!!!
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you for being there for me. I hope we can stay being friends for a long time.</b>
