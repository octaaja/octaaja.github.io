                        I genuinely think meeting you this year was one of the best things I did for myself. I have never met someone I could be my complete self with in a very long time and you stayed around to experience that, so I am very thankful for your presence in my life. I know weve been having a lot of misunderstandings and fights recently but I feel like even if we couldve avoided it, we come out stronger from talking things out and I am glad we can both grow and learn together.

                        It took a lot for me to get to this point where I can feel free enough to be me in front of people, especially the ones I care about, and you have showed me that the people that want to be with me will stay with me and accept that. I deff learnt a lot from your bluntness and I could use more of it in the future.

                        I dont know what the new year will bring for us but I want you to know that, I cant wait to make more memories with you and to do more stupid things that we can regret (or not) later. I hope you dont get sick of me double, triple, quadruple texting you, my loud ass voice and me asking you to join me everywhere when I dont want to go out alone. 
You make me feel very comfy when were together and I want you to continue being the (yappy) listener to this duo.
